## General info
The game was written for my daughter. I also wanted to train object oriented programming.

You start the game by selecting a letter from the alphabet table. When an image appears, your goal is to create the word that that image represents. You make a word from mixed up letters with two randomly added letters. When you finish the task, you will earn a point. After collecting six points, a reward will appear.
